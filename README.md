Problems:-
1. Unstable climate- Agriculture in India mainly depends on monsoon season. 
As a result, production of food- grains fluctuate every year. Then it leads to price income and employment fluctuations.
2. Not all farmers are educated- Farmers harvest crops based on their previous experience or based on suggestions given by their neghbours. They donot what is the exact proportion of water, 
or salt or other nutrients available in his farm.  Moreover, some farmers donot have information about extension agents.
3. Most of the farmers are not aware of crop rotation- Most of the farmers neglect crop rotation.Eg: If cereals are growin in a plot of land its fertility reduces to some extent. 
This can be restored if crops such are pulses are grown on the same plot on rotational basis
4. Small and poor farmers are not aware of the current market situations
So, to resolve these problems and help farmers of India to double their income, this project "Smart Farming" was proposed:

Solution:-
This project will help farmers in deciding what crops to grow in their farm.
It Provides farmers with current and accurate weather conditions using IoT weather station.
This project helps in giving accurate soil moisture level using IoT soil moisture station.
This projec makes use of two different IoT application providers i.e. Thingspeak and Amazon Web services.
Also provides other soil physical and chemical properties.
